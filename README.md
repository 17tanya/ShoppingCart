# ShoppingCart
INFORMATICS PRACTICES PROJECT: SHOPPING CART uses Java, Netbeans and MySQL.
This is a project based on online shopping. In this new age, with more dreams and less time, people tend not to waste time waiting in lines to pay for their articles, thus they turn to online stores for their needs. This project is just a sample of the vast prospects in online shopping.

The user logs in or signs up to the store and is then taken to the categories page. The user can choose among various categories-clothes, watches and books. On clicking the image of the object the description of the item is displayed. Once an item is added to the cart, its quantity can be changed and it can be deleted. Attractive discounts are also offered on playing a game. Online shopping has the convenience of various modes of payment for example cash on delivery, credit/debit card.
